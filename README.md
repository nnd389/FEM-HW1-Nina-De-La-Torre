# FEM-HW1-Nina-De-La-Torre
This repository holds all the files for HW1 for CSE397. Since Canvas only allows me to submit one document I thought it would make the most sense being able to access files and scripts separately on a github repository. 

- Immediately under this ReadMe, you will find the writeup (handwritten) with figures.
- Under the write up you will find the code to generate the figures. All my code is in
matlab, and you can copy and paste each script for each part into a .m file, namely Part
A, Part B, Part C, Part B (1), and Part B (2). For each script you justt have to press run
and it will produce three figures.
- At the very end are all the individual figures.
