## FEM-HW1-Nina-De-La-Torre
This repository contains all the files for Homework 1 (HW1) for CSE 397. Since Canvas only allows me to submit one document, it would make the most sense to be able to access files and scripts separately on a GitHub repository.
- The write up is in the main folder called "Nina HW1 FEM Writeup.pdf" and has figures to reference. 
- You will find all the figures in the "figures" folder. 
- All my code is in matlab and can be found in the "Matlab Code" folder. There is a separate script for each part, namely Part A, Part B, Part C, Part B (1), and Part B (2). For each script you just have to press run and it will produce three figures.
